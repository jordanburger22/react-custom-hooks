# Introduction to Custom Hooks in React

## What are Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks are special functions in React that allow you to extract and reuse logic across multiple components. They leverage the built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` to manage stateful logic and side effects.

## Why Use Custom Hooks?

### Benefits:

- **Code Reusability:** Share common logic between components without duplicating code.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep components focused on their primary responsibilities by separating logic from presentation.
- **Abstraction and Composition:** Build higher-level abstractions and compose multiple hooks to create complex functionality.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Encapsulate complex logic within custom hooks, making components simpler and easier to understand.
